In the decentralized realm, the traditional checks and balances differ, meaning individuals possess greater autonomy over their actions. While this freedom brings numerous advantages, it also mandates users to exhibit heightened responsibility. Gambling on a decentralized platform requires conscious decisions and awareness of potential risks.

### **Features to support responsible gambling on Mooncake Bets**
