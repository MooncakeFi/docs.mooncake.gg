# Token Features

### 1**. Deflationary Nature**

The $MCAKE token stands distinct due to its deflationary characteristics. Unlike the vast majority of tokens which are infinite in their supply, $MCAKE is limited. This scarcity is further amplified by a unique mechanism where a portion of the casino's revenue is used to buy back and burn $MCAKE. As a result, the overall supply diminishes over time, potentially increasing the token's value.

### **2. Staking Benefits**

Staking is a primary feature of $MCAKE. By staking their tokens, players not only receive rewards but are also granted privileged access and special in-game advantages. This encourages token retention, fostering a robust and committed community around the Mooncake Bets platform.

### **3. Enhanced Return to Player (RTP)**

Players have the option to burn their $MCAKE tokens in exchange for a heightened RTP in their games. This offers a tangible advantage, potentially increasing the player's chances of winning in the casino games they partake in.

### **4. Versatile Utility in Gaming**

The utility of $MCAKE isn't just restricted to staking and burning. Players can use the token directly to participate in various games on the Mooncake Bets platform. This incorporation of $MCAKE into gameplay further cements its role and significance within the ecosystem.

### **5. Incentive Programs**

Mooncake Bets believes in rewarding its loyal community. As such, $MCAKE is used as a prime incentive for players and promoters alike. Every bet placed translates to $MCAKE rewards. Moreover, those who contribute to growing the platform's social presence are also rewarded with the token. Simply put, the more a player engages with the platform, whether through wagers or promotional activities, the more $MCAKE tokens they stand to earn.
