# Provably Fair Casino

Our commitment to the 'Provably Fair' system ensures that every game outcome is genuinely random and verifiable by players.

### **Understanding 'Provably Fair'**

Rooted in blockchain technology, the 'Provably Fair' algorithm guarantees that game actions, such as drawing a card, remain unpredictable. Not just a buzzword at Mooncake Bets, this system allows every player to validate the randomization process themselves, introducing an unmatched trust layer.

### **How is Mooncake Bets Different?**

* **Transparent Randomization:** Through the provably fair algorithm, game outcomes are stored in a verifiable hash, eliminating the need for blind faith.
* **No External Verification Needed:** With our blockchain foundation serving as a public ledger and adherence to the provably fair principles, third-party verification becomes redundant.
* **Player-Powered Verification:** Mooncake Bets offers players the tools to personally validate game results, heightening trust and transparency.

### **Mechanics of the Provably Fair System:**

#### Three pivotal variables drive our system:

* **Serverseed:** Mooncake Bets provides this, symbolizing our dedication to fairness.
* **Clientseed:** The player's browser generates this, introducing an additional randomness degree.
* **Nonce:** This value escalates with every game, allowing players to monitor individual game rounds.

Before starting a game, players obtain an encrypted hash of the serverseed. This step guarantees that neither party can manipulate the outcome after the game begins. Our proprietary token, $MCAKE, incorporated into this ecosystem, amplifies the Mooncake Bets experience by offering both rewards and trust.

### **Contrasting Provably Fair Casinos and Traditional Casinos:**

_Provably Fair Casinos_:

* Utilize the provably fair algorithm for results.
* Remove the need for third-party validation, thanks to blockchain's transparency.
* Are self-sufficient in their validation processes due to blockchain's inherent trust.

_Traditional Casinos_:

* Depend on random number generators.
* Prohibit players from directly validating results.
* Rely on external organizations for validation.

### **Ensuring Fairness and Verification:**

_Post-game, players receive the unhashed serverseed to verify fairness. They can:_

1. Match the provided hashed serverseed to the actual hash of the unhashed version.
2. Compute each game outcome independently and contrast with the given results.

Online verifiers, available on reputable platforms, simplify this process. Players can input seeds and total bet counts, and the verifier produces a game result list for cross-referencing.
