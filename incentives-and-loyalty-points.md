# Incentives and Loyalty Points

### **Overview**

Mooncake Bets introduces a unique model to incentivize its users through a system of loyalty points. This system rewards users with $MCAKE tokens, the native currency of Mooncake Bets, based on their engagement and participation in various activities. The key to maximizing rewards is not just active participation but also maintaining a high level of loyalty.

### **Points System**

Users can earn points in multiple ways, which are crucial for acquiring $MCAKE tokens. The points system is designed to be straightforward: different tasks or activities contribute a specific number of points. These tasks could range from placing bets to engaging with the platform on social media.

* **Earning Points:** Points are allocated for activities such as placing bets, participating in special events, or even simple actions like following Mooncake Bets on Twitter. The amount of points earned can vary based on the task's complexity and engagement level required.
* **Conversion to Tokens:** Accumulated points can be converted into $MCAKE tokens. The conversion rate and the mechanism are transparent and user-friendly, ensuring users clearly understand how their engagement translates into rewards.
* **Dollar Value Wagering:** The more dollar value wagered in bets, the higher the points awarded. This encourages active participation in betting while also rewarding high-stake players.

### **Loyalty System**

Loyalty is a crucial factor in the Mooncake Bets ecosystem. It ensures that continuous and consistent engagement is more rewarding than sporadic participation.

* **Loyalty Measurement:** Loyalty is measured by consistent activity on the platform. Regular betting, frequent engagement, and continued social media interaction are some ways to maintain high loyalty.
* **Impact on Rewards:** Loyalty significantly influences the rewards users receive. A high loyalty score can enhance the value of the care packages users receive at the end of a betting season.

### **Point Allocations and Boosts**

Points allocation in Mooncake Bets is dynamic, with different activities providing varying points. Some tasks might offer more points than others, and there may be occasional boosts for specific activities.

* **Dynamic Allocations:** The point allocations for different tasks may change based on various factors, such as promotional events or platform priorities.
* **Boosts:** Users can earn extra points through periodic boosts. For example, following Mooncake Bets on Twitter during a promotional period might yield more points than usual.
