### **Step 3. Choosing Your Number:**

* Look for the 'ROLL ABOVE' slider. This allows you to select a number between 1 and 100.
* Drag the slider to your desired number. The chosen number represents the minimum number you need to roll above to win your bet.

### **Step 4. Understanding Risk and Reward:**

* The higher the number you choose on the slider, the greater the potential reward. However, this also means a greater risk as the chance of rolling above that number decreases.
* You can see the potential 'PAYOUT' and 'WIN CHANCE' updating in real-time as you adjust the slider, helping you make an informed decision.

### **Step 6. Outcome:**

A random number between 1 and 100 will be rolled.

* If the rolled number is higher than your chosen number, congratulations, you win! The reward will be shown under 'PAYOUT ON WIN'.
* If the number is lower, you'll lose the amount you've wagered.

### **Step 7. Insufficient Funds:**

If you don't have enough ETH in your wallet to place a bet, you'll be prompted with a message. Click on 'Fund Your Account' to add more funds.
